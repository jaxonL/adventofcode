# Advent of Code (2020)

Code used for the challenges for 2020's [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

## Why I'm back

I'm almost graduating soon (yay! but also anxious) and I wanted to apply to jobs "in advance". I know I am hard to motivate, so interview prep is doubly hard (I'm coding during the day, for my last internship, and you tell me I have to code at night as well??). Then I remembered that it was December, and I could do some digestible, fun programming for AoC like I did two years ago to learn Python. I have gotten the chance to work with Python closely this year, but well, a knife dulls when it is not sharpened often (or something).

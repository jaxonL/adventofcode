# Advent of Code (2020)

Code used for the challenges for 2020's [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

## Why I'm back

I'm almost graduating soon (yay! but also anxious) and I wanted to apply to jobs "in advance". I know I am hard to motivate, so interview prep is doubly hard (I'm coding during the day, for my last internship, and you tell me I have to code at night as well??). Then I remembered that it was December, and I could do some digestible, fun programming for AoC like I did two years ago to learn Python. I have gotten the chance to work with Python closely this year, but well, a knife dulls when it is not sharpened often (or something).

## Day 1: Report Repair (Dec 6)

### Pre-code

(Part 1) Sounds like a simple task. My gut instinct tells me to first sort the list, and use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end, to do summations. We can also jump numbers that way when calculating how much we need to make 2020.

### During code and onto part 2

Wait... how do I Python again? It took me some time to go into it, but I got it. And I forgot there was a second part haha.

Three numbers... I'm pretty sure I've seen this before. Maybe keeping the same approach, and adding a third pointer that moves around may help?
